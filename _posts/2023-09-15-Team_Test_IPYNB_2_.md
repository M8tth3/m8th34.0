### Program with Output
- Include a code example that demonstrates a simple program with an output.


```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

<hr style="solid">

### Program with Input / Output
- Show a program that takes user input and produces output.


```python
name = input("Enter your name: ") print("Hello, " + name + "!") 
```

<hr style="solid">

### Program with a List
- Demonstrate a program that uses a list.


```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] 
for fruit in fruits: print(fruit) 
```

<hr style="solid">

### Program with a Dictionary
- Showcase a program utilizing a dictionary.


```python
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"} 
print(person["name"]) 
```

<hr style="solid">

### Program with Iteration
- Provide an example of a program that uses iteration (e.g., a for loop).


```python
for i in range(5): 
    print(i) 
```

<hr style="solid">

### Program with a Function
- Create a function that performs a mathematical or statistical calculation.


```python
def calculate_average(numbers): 
    total = sum(numbers) 
    return total / len(numbers)
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
average = calculate_average(numbers) 
print("Average:", average) 
```

<hr style="solid">

### Program with a Selection/Condition
- Include a program with a selection or condition (e.g., if/else statement).


```python
x = 10 
if x > 5: 
    print("x is greater than 5") 
else: 
    print("x is not greater than 5") 
```

<hr style="solid">

### Debugging
- Explain the overall purpose of this program, summarizing what you've covered.


```python
# Initial version with an error
x = 10
y = 0
try:
    result = x / y
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Error:", e)

# Debugging steps to fix the error
try:
    if y == 0:
        raise ValueError("y cannot be zero")
    result = x / y
except ValueError as e:
    print("Error:", e)


# Corrected version
def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        raise ValueError("y cannot be zero")
    return x / y
try:
    result = divide(x, y)
except ValueError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
else:
    print("Result:", result)
```


```python
# Debugging steps to fix the error 
try: 
    if y == 0: 
        raise ValueError("y cannot be zero") 
    result = x / y 
except ValueError as e: 
    print("Error:", e) 
```

The code block above demonstrates the steps to fix the error by checking for a zero division condition and raising a ``ValueError`` with a meaningful error message.


```python
# Corrected version:
def divide(x, y): 
    if y == 0: 
        raise ValueError("y cannot be zero") 
    return x / y 
try: 
    result = divide(x, y) 
except ValueError as e: 
    print("Error:", e) 
else: 
    print("Result:", result) 
```

The code block above provides the corrected version of the code using a ``divide`` function that includes the fix. It also includes error handling to catch and handle any exceptions, and it prints the result if there are no errors.

### Program with Purpose


```python
import requests

def get_weather(api_key, city):
    base_url = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
    params = {
        "q": city,
        "appid": api_key,
        "units": "metric",  # Change to "imperial" for Fahrenheit
    }

    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        weather_data = response.json()
        temperature = weather_data["main"]["temp"]
        description = weather_data["weather"][0]["description"]
        print(f"Weather in {city}:")
        print(f"Temperature: {temperature}Â°C")
        print(f"Description: {description.capitalize()}")
    else:
        print("Error fetching weather data. Please check your city name and API key.")

def main():
    api_key = "23041de8a421616f9c9c808ce3ea80d9"  # Replace with your OpenWeatherMap API key
    city = input("Enter your city: ")
    get_weather(api_key, city)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
