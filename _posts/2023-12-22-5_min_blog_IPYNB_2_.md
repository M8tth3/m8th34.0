## What Helped
I learned a lot of things during CSP which helped me on the multiple choice practice quiz. One of the most important things was taking the previous practice exam because this let me get a feel for what types of questions will be asked. It is important for students to attempt other practice tests because they show the question format. They are also a good way to understand the content that will be asked such as code questions or math related questions.

Another thing that helped me was the AP Classroom lectures which were taught by students. Because the exam was on these lectures, the student lessons helped a lot in understanding the topics. The team teaches all had explanations and also had homework for me to practice on. 

Also, making a team teach myself was useful. To make the team teach, our group had to watch the videos and take notes on them in order to format and make a write-up on the topic. It was also a good way to figure out how to teach material which is important in learning. It is said that the greatest form of learning is the ability to teach another person. This is very true as we learned a lot when we were making our team teach. We had to know the information well enough in order to present it in a way students will understand because we had to know what we were talking about. 

## What I Discovered
Some things that I discovered was that for me, I am not very good at abstract thinking and trying to visualize things. A lot of the questions on the practice quiz were abstract and most of the code and questions were like this. I had to learn how to process information in an easy to understand format and I usually just used paper to write things down since I can’t memorize things well. I also learned that I need to understand the college board pseudo code format more because their method of formatting is unconventional and is at times confusing. I looked over practice problems and the pseudo code syntax guide they gave which was really helpful because many of the questions were code related. This means you have to understand the syntax so that you can know what the code is doing and know what the prompt is asking. Most prompts asked to fix or modify code so it’s important to understand the syntax to understand the code in order to fix it.

## Questions Reflection
Out of the questions I got wrong, most of them were code or logic questions which means that I don’t fully understand them. One question was asking the result of multiple logic gates connected to each other and what values should be put in the gates to get a certain output as a result. I messed this question up because I think that my understanding of logic gates is not complete, mainly when several gates are combined with several inputs leading to one output.

Other questions were code related questions. One asked to compare the outputs of two different pieces of code when they ran. I didn’t get the question right because I was unable to visualize the code running and figure out what the result would look like. Another question was similar but it asked to debug an error in a short piece of code. Once again, I messed it up because I couldn’t visualize the code.

### Q67 Error in numOccurrences procedure
I had only selected A and this was because I made a dumb mistake of not properly reading the question and forgetting to select D. I should make sure to read all the directions.

### Q23 Flowchart to set available
I chose B: Incorrect. This expression would be equivalent to an algorithm that sets available to true whenever weekday is true and miles is at least 20. The algorithm in the flowchart requires both conditions to be true in order to set available to true. 

I find that I tend to struggle with logic diagrams and I am not that good at abstract thinking. I'm not sure if we can have paper for the exam because I cannot really remember information and store it well.

### Q15 Compare output of program a and b
I chose C. Incorrect. While the two programs initialize i to different values, the same values are printed inside the loop because program A prints i and then increments it and program B increments i and then prints it. Once again, I can't really store information well and it's really hard for me to track things and make sure that I get the answer correct.

### Q14 Print digits algorithm
I chose C: Step 3: Display the integer quotient of number divided by 10 and store the remainder in number. The answer is B because it divides until hitting 0.

### Q5 Inputs to logic circuit
I chose D: A = false, B = false, C = true,  D = true. Here the result performs true then goes to the next gate and produces false.

## For The Future...
For the future, I think that practicing more with the AP classroom practice exams would help. I also think that reviewing the team teaches would help and attempting to redo the homework would also help. Furthermore, watching the rest of the AP classroom videos would help a lot. I didn’t watch most of the videos because I did the team teaches instead and the only videos I watched were the ones I needed when making our team teach. However, I think watching the rest of the videos even though they aren’t part of our team teaching would be helpful because the information they explain is easy to understand. Also, they show what the college board is looking for and the videos teach concepts the way the college board thinks will be best for students when the exam comes.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, using tools such as the team teaches and the practice quiz helped in doing well on the practice quiz and I think that reviewing over other AP classroom videos and reviewing the team teaches and redoing the homework would help improve my score even more.
