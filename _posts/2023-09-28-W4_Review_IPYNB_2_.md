### Python Data Types, Lists, and Dictionaries

For the Python Data Types, Lists, and Dictionaries, I created an info db and manipulated its fields. I also created a for loop with an index as well as doind the pair share code where I append data and print it all out. 

### Correcting Errors

For the Correcting Errors, I wrote several snippets of python code demonstrating integral aspects of coding such as input output, lists and dictionary, as well as logic and debugging. The program w/ purpose is a weather app which uses an API to fetch data.
