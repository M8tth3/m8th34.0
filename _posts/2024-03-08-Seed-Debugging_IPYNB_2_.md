### Debugging

[Debugging](https://github.com/KinetekEnergy/blog/issues/4)


### Individual Seed

I believe that I deserve 100% (3/3) on the seed project for the following reasons:



* I got above 93% last trimester of CompSci
    * <img src="images/grades.png" width="" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip">
* I consistently and equally contributed to the project along with my partners Advik, Yeongsu, and William. We had lots of team communication and helped each other. This is proven by our message count below (Discord)
    * <img src="images/groupchat.png" width="" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip">
* I have a GitHub Pages Blog which serves as a log of everything, including the post you’re reading ([Blog link](https://kinetekenergy.github.io/blog/))
    * Major example of using the blog for planning: [Link](https://kinetekenergy.github.io/blog/posts/Unfied-Post_IPYNB_2_/)
    * Another example which is related to ideation: [Link](https://kinetekenergy.github.io/blog/posts/Checkpoint_IPYNB_2_/)
    * This post contains all important information from trimester one. It includes checkpoints, multiple spot checks, ideation and planning, N@TM pictures and reflection, and more. You may have already seen this post when grading me last trimester!
* I understand all the AP work, making sure to review all the questions of the practice MC: [Link](https://kinetekenergy.github.io/blog/posts/5_min_blog_IPYNB_2_/)
* I have great GitHub Analytics and Key Commits:
    * [Commit 1](https://github.com/Napoleon-Bonaparte-Official/corsica-frontend/commit/bbce2f295fe3414cd2a97ae3b756fe65d57ffc87)
    * [Commit 2](https://github.com/Napoleon-Bonaparte-Official/corsica-backend/commit/6352cfac8f3f499751d44ce573be3aadc324f4fb)
    * Blog which details more about these commits: [Link](https://kinetekenergy.github.io/blog/posts/CSP-Final_IPYNB_2_/#features-prior-to-implementation)
    * GitHub issue which details more about these commits: [Link](https://github.com/Napoleon-Bonaparte-Official/corsica-blog/issues/3)
    * Note that the first image is of javascript frontend/backend integration on the frontend repo while the second is on the backend.

### Team Seed

## Seed (Team)


### Groups

1. Groups (Aashray, Kyle, Aashray, Matthew, Trevor)
    1. Subgroups: 
        1. Aashray, Kyle, Aashray
            1. Kyle: scrum master
            2. Aashray: 
            3. Aashray: 
        2. Matthew, Trevor
            4. Matthew: Model work(backend)
            5. Trevor: API and model management(frontend)

### Integration

1. Matthew & Trevor:
    1. Working on our individually cloned repos, then via daily-standups every other day we share our progress to keep each other updated. Our weekly goals will involve integrating each other's progress into our individual CPT projects, dissecting each other’s code, practicing good commenting habits, pull requests, and consistent github issues/blogs to make it easy to track and integrate each other's features.
2. Aashray, Kyle, Aashray:
    2. We are planning on integrating our ideas into our CPT projects and discussing each other’s code. We are also planning to review each other and track what we are doing with project boards, blogs, and github issues. We are also going to make branches to practice safe coding.

### Specifics (Last Tri Features)

1. Matthew & Trevor:
    1. Trevor: Friend request trading system.
    2. Matthew: Baking and Drag/Dropping system
2. Aashray, Kyle, Aashray:
    3. Aashray: Login
    4. Kyle: Likes
    5. Aashray: Message posting

### Functions

1. Matthew & Trevor:
    1. We will be using a kaggle data set of pre-existing recipes[ Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/recipenlg)
    2. On frontend, user selects certain parameters for what kind of recipe they want to introduce into the game
    3. Model on the backend will predict the best recipe to add to the game based on the items the current user has and the dataset
    4. Both members worked on the same project last trimester
2. Aashray, Kyle, Aashray:
    5. We are going to use a kaggle data set: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tkm22092/indian-number-plate-images)
    6. The frontend allows a user to upload an image of their license plate and a route
    7. Backend model will identify the plate and state. User can also upload routes like a daily commute route and it can predict fines

### Other

1. Titanic machine learning
    2. Develop teacher code by:
        3. Integrating machine learning and artificial intelligence into out project
        4. Creating a frontend UI for the project so that it is easy for users to use
        5. Adapt and use a new dataset which better suits our previous projects
        6. Realistic constraints and parameters
2. Organization
    3. Pull requests with a unified naming scheme
        7. EX: feature/branch-name
        8. EX: bugfix/branch-name
    4. Weekly plans using the project board
        9. Issues to keep track of what needs to be done
        10. Project board will also keep track of the features that were already complete
    5. Code reviews 
3. Next steps mindset
    6. Issues for individual work and adding to plans
        11. This is the draft schedule that we are considering using
            6. Monday: Work Day
            7. Tuesday: Crossover Review
            8. Wednesday: Check in with teacher
            9. Thursday: Work Day
            10. Friday: Update plans
        12. We are going to use a github project board to track plans and make issues
    7. Coding, Integration, and Test planning
        13. [Incomplete Schedule](https://github.com/orgs/MKAAT/projects/2/views/1)


#### CPT Project Integration



* Aashray: Front end styling but also frontend/backend integration (ex: post requests for login). Lots of JS which helped with error handling (ex: a 404 popup window) and integration with backend
* Yeongsu: Helped with me (Aashray) a lot, especially on the video system. He helped with the JS for fetching videos and thumbnails as well as video titles, view count, descriptions, and the user who made the video
* Advik: Major backend person who helped a lot with the database and handling of videos so that a user can upload a video, thumbnail, and have it be sent to the backend
* Will: Helped with frontend and backend in terms of getting the view count system to work as well as a lot of the deployment (docker, AWS server, and whatnot).
