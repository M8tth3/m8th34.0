### Datatypes
I created an object, logged it, and manipulated its fields.

### DOM
I created a simple website with 3 buttons. 2 have a link & 1 swtiches the links while updatingn a status indicator.

### JS
Simple JS snippet which compares the values of two variables using if else code which uses logic to evaluate several statements and display the results.

### Debug I
Code was pushing number to the alphabet list. Changed so that it fetches from alphabet array and pushes that instead.

### Debug II
1. For loop now iterates letterNumber times
2. For loop uses j instead of i
3. For loop checks current letter for match with e
4. Log now prints the letter and the correct number

### Debug III
Changed i to 1 to offset list and print odds.
