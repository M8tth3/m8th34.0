## Team Evaluation

Period 5 Lopez, Safe Computing

- Aashray R: 0.96
  - Completed the section about the personal identifiable information and the explanation about what it is. Also completed the list about the different types of PII's and their level of sensitivity. Also wrote most of the popcorn hacks.
- Will C: 0.98
  - Wrote about nefarious uses of the internet. Talked about what viruses are and what they could do. Talked about different viruses and how they act differently to compromise a machine in a different way. Also talked about phishing attacks and what they do.
- Yeongsu K: 0.97
  - Wrote the requirements for what is a good password and precautions you should take so that you don't compromise your system and good practices to employ for passwords and overall security.
- Advik G: 1
  - Wrote the entire section about cryptography. Talked about what is: difference between passwords and keys, types of encryption (symmetric vs asymmetric), examples of algorithms, cryptography demo (live demo about it). Also talked about cryptography with the Alice and Bob explanation and described public-keys and private-keys. Wrote about SSL and TLS too.

### Elements of Creativity or Success

Elements of success for me was the college board AP practice multiple choice exam that I did recently in which I got a good score. I wrote a [5 Min Blog](https://kinetekenergy.github.io/blog/posts/5_min_blog_IPYNB_2_/) on this which talks about all the problems I got wrong and the solutions to them. It also talks about my process to getting a good score. Other elements of success was our team teach: safe computing. I personally think that we as a team did a really good job of doing research on our topic and presenting it to the class. I think we also did a good job on giving homework that tests students' knowledge as well as grading everything on time and grading fairly.
