    "\n",
    "Binary search is like a guessing game where you halve your options at each step. Imagine you're finding a name in a phone book:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Step:** You open the book in the middle.\n",
    "2. **Second Step:** Is the name before or after the middle? You eliminate half of the remaining names.\n",
    "3. **Repeat:** Keep dividing until you find the name or run out of names to check.\n",
    "4. **MAKE SURE YOUR LIST IS SORTED** Binary search will not work if the list isn't sorted\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you're halving the options each time, it's super quick. If you have \\(n\\) names, it takes at most \\( \\log_2(n) \\) steps to find a name. This efficiency, where the time it takes doesn't increase much as the number of names in the phone book grows, is what makes binary search awesome! Binary search is also more optimal for searcihng compared to a linear search for anything that doesnt include small lists..\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demo Being shown above\n",
    "The sorted list we have currently, has integers [1, 3, 4, 5, 13, 20], we are currently trying to find the index of the the integer 1 within the list\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works is we start at element 0 for our left position and element 5 for our rightwards position\n",
    "\n",
    "Our middle position becaomes 5 because ((5+0)//2)=3 so element 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Our element 3 within the list gives us the integer 5\n",
    "\n",
    "We then realize that oh 5 is greater then 3 so we have to move leftwards\n",
    "\n",
    "Then to make the algorithm more efficient we move the r backwards 1 beacuse we have already checked at this point\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we can reduce the list to [1, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can repeat the same steps as before and find the middle of this list which is 3\n",

It's a lot faster then the iterative approach, where I keep going until I get to 59223 what this does is it allows me to speed up the time and memory usage I take. because I keep dividing the list by 2 allowing for me to form a logarithm because its just repetitive multiplication of 1/2 and then that makes it so that O(log(n)) becomes the time complexity for the Binary search algorithm.\n",
