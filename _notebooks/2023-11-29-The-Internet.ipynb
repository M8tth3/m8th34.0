    "# The OSI Model and TCP/IP Model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TCP/IP Protocols\n",
    "A TCP/IP Protocol is a set of rules that governs something within computer communication.\n",
    "The IETF, or Internet Engineering Task Force, manages these rules and facilitates the open development of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: ASCII Protocol\n",
    " - ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a internet protocol that you may be familiar with, is a type of character encoding\n",
    " - ASCII is a protocol governing how text is represented as binary\n",
    " - 128 characters, 95 printable\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more protocols, each governing a specific area of how computer communicate.\n",
    "Ex. ARP, DNS, FTP, UDP, PPP, SAP\n",
    "\n",
    "We obviously can't cover every protocol, but we'll be talking about a few important ones today.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OSI Model\n",
    "The OSI model, also known as the Open Systems Interconnection Model, helps represent communications between two computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The OSI model helps coordinate and classify standards\n",
    "- Each of the many protocols can be classified into one of the seven layers\n",
    "- Each layer has a function and the protocols in that layer all help with that function\n",

    "# Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "## DNS - Domain Name Service\n",
    "- DNS, or Domain Name Service, is a naming system for websites on the internet.\n",
    "- DNS assigns and has records that relate domain names to ip addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Domain Name?\n",
    " - Domain Names are strings used to identify addresses\n",
    " - They map hard to remember IP addresses into simple string of text\n",
    " - Would you rather remember 162.159.128.233 or discord.com?\n",

    " - Try visiting that website in your search bar!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subdomains\n",
    " - Subdomains are a prefix added to a domain to separate parts of the website\n",
    " - There can many subdomains, up to 127, and each can be up to 64 characters long\n",
    " - We saw an example of this in our passion projects\n",

    "## HTTP vs HTTPS - HyperText Transfer Protocol\n",
    "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are both protocols used for transferring data over the web. The key difference lies in the security aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP is the standard protocol for transmitting data over the internet. However, it does not provide any encryption, making it susceptible to eavesdropping and unauthorized access. This means that any information exchanged between the user's browser and the website, such as login credentials or personal data, is sent in plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTTPS\n",
    "On the other hand, HTTPS adds a layer of security by incorporating SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption. This encryption ensures that the data exchanged between the user and the website is encrypted, making it much more challenging for malicious actors to intercept or tamper with the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ![image](../../..images/httpvshttpsdiagram.png) -->\n",
    "\n",
    "We SSL based encryption last trimester with certbot. Certbot generated SSL certificates for us to ensure HTTPS \n",

    "\n",
    "## TCP and UDP - Transmission Control Protocol and User Datagram Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "TCP and UDP are both Transport protocols (layer 4 of OSI and layer 3 of TCP/IP). This means they are a set of rules that specify how data is exchanged between devices over the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TCP Packets\n",
    "What's in a TCP packet?\n",
    "Packets are a unit of information that are sent over the network. They contain user data, among other identification information.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://linuxbeans.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/2498f-tcppacketformatdiagram.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TCP Handshake\n",
    "The TCP handshake process - this is how a TCP session is initiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Client A requests a client-to-server communication session with Server B (SYN)\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://i.ibb.co/xD9sN2V/Image-11-27-23-at-8-34-PM.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Server B acknowledges client-to-server communication session, requests server-to-client communication session (SYN-ACK)\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://i.ibb.co/xgQS4wV/Image-11-27-23-at-8-34-PM-1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Client A acknowledges server-to-client communication session (ACK)\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://i.ibb.co/gw2WB3h/Image-11-27-23-at-8-34-PM-2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "After these steps are executed in order, the communication pathway is established between Client A and Server B.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does TCP actually send the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Client A wants to send some file to Server B. TCP will first split the data into 6 segments\n",
    "2. TCP forwards the first 3 segments to the Server B\n",
    "3. Server B must acknowledge that it has received the segments by sending back an ACK. If Client A doesn't receive the ACK, it resends the segments\n",
    "4. Client A sends the remaining 3 segments\n",
    "5. Again, Server B must send back an ACK to confirm it has received the other 3 segments\n",
    "\n",
    "TCP Session Termination\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Client A sends segment to server B with the FIN flag to terminate the client-to-server session\n",
    "2. Server B sends ACK to client A\n",
    "3. Server B sends FIN to client A to terminate the server-to-client session\n",
    "4. Client A sends ACK to server B\n",
    "5. The session closes\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://i.ibb.co/KwHfcj0/Image-11-27-23-at-8-50-PM.jpg\" alt=\"Image-11-27-23-at-8-50-PM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### UDP\n",
    "Enough about TCP... what about UDP?\n",
    "\n",
    "UDP Pros:\n",
    "- Little cost\n",
    "- Faster\n",
    "\n",
    "UDP Cons:\n",
    "- Little data checking\n",
    "- Generally unreliable, as no ACK messages are sent\n",
    "- Packets may arrive out of order or have duplicates/missing packets\n",
    "\n",
    "UDP sends out all packets at once without any form of handshake or acknowledgement. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Popcorn Hack\n",
    " - When do we use UDP? While it seems terrible, try to think of some use cases!\n",
    "   - **UDP is used for streaming data (netflix) where accuracy is not needed**\n",
    " - When might we use TCP?\n",
    "   - **TCP is used for when data must be accurate like emails**\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Models\n",
    "1. Three of the four following protocols are on the same layer. Identify which ones and what layer they are on, and why they are on each layer:\n",
    "   1. ASCII (see above for information)\n",
    "      1. **No protocol but is used on applicatoin layer for text**\n",
    "   2. FTP (facilitates transfer of files over the internet)\n",
    "      1. **Application layer and responsible for file transfer**\n",
    "   3. TLS (see HTTPS section)\n",
    "      1. **Transport layer and used for HTTPS secure transfer**\n",
    "   4. USB (permits data exchange between electronics)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Telnet is a internet protocol which allows remote access to other computers over a local network or the internet. What layer of the OSI model would this protocol be located on? What is the function of this layer?\n",
    "   1. **Telnet is on layer 7 because it's for applications. Layer 7 serves as an interface for communication.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DNS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bob wants to use the domain bob.is.the.best.com. What domain should he buy from a DNS provider (assume it is available)? What would be the subdomains?\n",
    "   1. **Main Domain: best.com**\n",
    "   2. **Subdomains: bob.is.the**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTTP and HTTPS\n",
    "1. What is a difference between HTTP and HTTPS? \n",
    "   1. **HTTPS is secure while HTTP is not**\n",
    "   2. What protocol does HTTPS use that HTTP doesn't?\n",
    "      1. **HTTPS uses TSL (SSL) to encrypt data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Last trimester we sent HTTP requests for our passion projects\n",
    "   1. Did we use HTTP or HTTPS?\n",
    "      1. **HTTP you just said we used HTTP requests**\n",
    "   2. What are the benefits and disadvantages of this?\n",
    "      1. **HTTP is much easier to work with since you don't have to worry about encryption but the downside is that it's not encrypted and is not secure.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TCP and UDP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bob is setting up a video streaming service, and he needs the stream to be real time. \n",
    "   1. What protocol should he use, TCP or UDP? Why?\n",
    "      1. **UDP because he doesn't need accuracy for the data but speed.**\n",
    "   2. What are some cons of this protocol? Give an example of a potential issue.\n",
    "      1. **UDP is great for uses where you need data to be transfered quickly without much accuracy. This could be a con because sometimes, you need accuracy like when you email.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TCP has error checking, which ensures that all packets arrive properly. Why is this important?\n",
    "   1. **This is important to make sure all packets arrive in the proper order and that you have the correct data.**\n",
    "   2. Give an example of how TCP ensures that there are no errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Server A computer is communicating with Server B. They have already initiated communication and Server A is now attempting to send data to Server B.\n",
    "   1. How does Server B ensure that they have received any sent packets before Server A continues sending packets in TCP? In UDP?\n",
    "      1. TCP:\n",
    "         1. **B sends ACK to A for recieved packets to tell A it got the packets**\n",
    "         2. **Sliding window mechanism prevents packet overload**\n",
    "      2. UDP:\n",
    "         1. **No inherent mechanism for ensuring packet delivery acknowledgement**\n",
    "   2. What is another use of this?\n",
    "      1. **Error checking and correction is a good use of this because TCP lets a server request retransmission which contributed to the integrity of the communication**"
