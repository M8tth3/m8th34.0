    "Elements of success for me was the college board AP practice multiple choice exam that I did recently in which I got a good score. I wrote a [5 Min Blog](https://kinetekenergy.github.io/blog/posts/5_min_blog_IPYNB_2_/) on this which talks about all the problems I got wrong and the solutions to them. It also talks about my process to getting a good score. Other elements of success was our team teach: safe computing. I personally think that we as a team did a really good job of doing research on our topic and presenting it to the class. I think we also did a good job on giving homework that tests students' knowledge as well as grading everything on time and grading fairly."
