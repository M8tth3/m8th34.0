    "## Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first part of the ML which is an adaptation to the titanic model. It’s a frontend to backend which has the “do you survive” titanic theme. It allows the user to input certain fields and it’ll predict your survival probability if you were on the titanic. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This part uses another API and ML to integrate with the existing titanic model. It allows you to insert a photo of yourself which will be sent to the backend where a deep learning algorithm will predict your age and gender. This gets sent to the titanic API along with the other information you add yourself (name, class, etc) to predict your survival. In other words, I added a separate machine learning algorithm to predict some of the required titanic values (age and gender) and nicely integrated it with the existing project!\n",

    "Here, you can see an option to insert a photo. This replaces the previous age and gender fields since the ML model will predict this for you. Other information which can’t be predicted (name, class, etc.) will be filled in by the user.\n",

    "![Loading Screen](images/loading_screen.png \"Loading Screen\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the age and gender detection takes some time. To greatly improve user friendliness, I added this loading animation. While I can’t show a video, all it does is blur the background and show a spinner. It helps a lot because it lets the user know something is happening. In most cases, a user may click on the send button again which will take even more time and run the model again and again (as I ended up doing, thinking it’s not working). The animation tells you the backend is running.\n",

Now, it doesn’t do this any more but I didn’t want to change all the variable names (and just in-case I do more Postman testing), so I left it as is. The first thing is to parse the string. Sometimes, base64 strings have headers. If they have this, we need to remove them. The next step is to decode the string and extract the bytes to convert to an image file. This gets stored in the cache and not locally to not flood the backend with a lot of files. The image is converted to a numpy array which is what we need for the ML. Next is the main part. We send our image to Deepface which is an amalgamation of Tensorflow, GhostFaceNet, Dlib, and more. This will analyze the image and only look for the attributes specified: gender and age.

We create more convolutional layers and flatten each one. It’s like stacking up pancakes! Then, we use the softmax to get probability distributions.
