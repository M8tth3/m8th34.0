    "### What errors may arise in your project?\n",
    "When programming something, it is very rare for it to work the first time and you will encounter many errors. The most common ones include:\n",
    "- Syntax errors\n",
    "- Arithmetic errors\n",
    "  - Many programs use algorithims or math to store data. You may encounter errors if you messed up your algorithim\n",
    "- Logic error\n",
    "  - You may have an error in which your program will operate incorrectly and not terminate\n",
    "- Runtime error\n",
    "  - An error in which something causes the computer to become confused and crash\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test cases that can be used\n",
    "- Any test scenario can be used and it depends on the program you make. Your test case must be able to test what you want to test however \n",
