    "## SASS Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Sass?**  \n",
    "Short for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets, SASS is a popular CSS pre-processor. SASS code is processed by the program and compiled into CSS code, which can be used to style HTML elements. SASS controls how it appears on the web page. It is compatible with all CSS versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SCSS vs CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is CSS?**  \n",
    "CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). For example, it is used to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is SCSS?  \n",
    "It is basically more advanced than CSS. SCSS assists a user in adding various extra features to the CSS, such as nesting, variables, etc. These extra features make the process of writing the SCSS language quicker and easier as compared to that of writing the standard language of CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt Text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nesting\n",
    "\n",
    "Nesting is a way to organize code for better readability. It involves placing one selector inside another.\n",
    "In regular CSS, SASS helps organize code. Avoid excessive nesting to prevent overqualified selectors that can be challenging to read and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "![CSS-Nesting-Example-without-Nesting.png](https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CSS-Nesting-Example-without-Nesting.png)\n",

    "![CSS-Nesting-Nesting-Example.png](https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CSS-Nesting-Nesting-Example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of SASS over traditional CSS\n",
    "- **Improved code organization:** SASS offers enhanced code organization through features like nested rules and modular imports, promoting a more structured and readable stylesheet.\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** SASS facilitates easier maintenance with variables, mixins, and functions, reducing code redundancy and making updates and changes more efficient.\n",
    "- **Advanced features:** SASS provides advanced features such as variables, mixins, inheritance, and logic operators. This allows for more dynamic stylesheets than CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modular SCSS\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Modular SCSS enables you to divide your SCSS files into several pieces and compile them into a unified CSS file. \n",
    "- add an underscore (_) before the filenames.scss \n",
    "- import it into your file without the underscore, and all the styles will come along\n",
    "- using a partial is that it allows you to break down the code for multiple components in larger websites\n",
    "- ll the styles in the partial will be included and can be used in the main file as if they were originally defined in the main file itself\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of Variables:\n",
    "A variable is essentially a container that stores a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance in SASS:\n",
    "In SASS, utilizing variables allows for the convenient reuse of a value throughout the stylesheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbol in Sass:\n",
    "The $ symbol is employed in Sass to signify and designate a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hack 1: \n",

    "- Conditional Statements in SASS function similarly to Python and JavaScript.\n",
    "- They enable the execution of different actions based on varying conditions.\n",
    "- Examples include executing specific actions if a condition is true or taking alternative actions if it is false.\n",

    "- SASS also provides the @else directive to define a set of styles if the preceding condition is not met or is false.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$condition1: true;\n",
    "$condition2: false;\n",
    "\n",
    ".element {\n",
    "  @if $condition1 {\n",
    "    color: blue; // Applied if $condition1 is true\n",
    "  } @else if $condition2 {\n",
    "    color: red; // Applied if $condition1 is false and $condition2 is true\n",
    "  } @else {\n",

    "### Loops in SASS\n",
    "- SASS features loops with @for, @while, and @each decorators.\n",
    "- Loops repeat a block of code a specific number of times or until a certain condition is met, similar to other programming languages.\n",
    "- For Loops iterate through a list of values or a range of numbers.\n",
    "- While Loops continue iterating through a block of code until a specific condition is true, like reaching a certain value or meeting another condition.\n",
    "- It's recommended to use @each and @for over while loops in SASS for clarity and faster compilation.\n",
    "- In SASS, lists are groups of values separated by commas or spaces, without special brackets like in JavaScript.\n",
    "- Lists are immutable in SASS, meaning they cannot be changed once created.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Define a list\n",
    "$colors: red, blue, green, yellow;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Use a @each loop to apply styles to each color in the list\n",
    "@each $color in $colors {\n",
