    "## Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Last trimester, our CPT project was a video sharing site. It would allow users to create an account and upload their own videos. These videos could be viewed by anyone and shared to others. For this trimester, we integrated all the other projects together. Kyle and Aashray’s project was a social media site while Matthew and Trevor’s project was a baking game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our integration project turned into this: a video sharing website (me) where users could comment on videos, like comments, and delete them (Aashray/Kyle). And watching videos would give users points. These points could be used to buy items (Trevor/Matthew).\n",

    "To create the users, see the second image. Here, we have a python function called `initUsers()` and this will create all the default users with all of their information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each user will have their real name and a username which will be displayed publicly on the site. They will also have their email and an account password. This will be for logging in. They also have a date of birth and an identifier if they’re an admin account. Admin accounts have special privileges like having access to a user dashboard. They can see every user and create or delete other users. This screenshot also demonstrates the integration.\n",

While the ID isn’t displayed to the user, it’s used to display the correct video even if two videos have the same title. Other metadata like likes, dislikes, and music is stored there and is tied to the video. So each video will have different metadata.\n",

Next, it creates table headers for each piece of data: \"Name\", \"UID\", \"ID #\", \"Email\", \"DOB\", and \"Role\". These headers are appended to a row (`<tr>`) within the table. Subsequently, the function iterates over each user's data within the provided array.

    "These two functions are what actually let us predict inflation in the future. We use linear regression to predict inflation rates based on certain timestamps. The second function will call the previous one using a future timestamp. It then returns the predicted inflation rate which is amplified. If we were to remove the amplifier, the inflation would actually take many years to have a significant effect (since it takes a long time in real life). To speed things up, we just amplify it to a large amount."
