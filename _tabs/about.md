<!-- ![about me drawing (freeform)](/blog/images/ab) -->

Look at this drawing. How perfect it is, yet how its imperfections constitutes its character. Such a masterpiece puts the greates artists to shame. The beauty behind its subtle details as well as the marvelous artistic choice to use black and white. Its colors may look insipid to the common person,
yet the choice of only using two colors creates a harmonious relationship of two. It is to be noted how many things come in two. We humans, the ultimate
manifestation of the universe have two eyes, two ears, two hands, etc. Two represents opposites: good and bad, light and dark. Whats more is the composition,
and the use of negative and positive space. Notice how the elements are balanced yet asymmetrical. And the texture representing the roughness of life, yet
the smoothness of victory. Its markmaking is clearly visible, depicting the artists touch and artifact on it. Its mood remains neutral, allowing the viewer to decide how they want to interpret this piece.

This work is a masterpiece. Those who cannot see it are deemed blind. Those who cannot feel the emotions running through them are deemed soulless.

This... is the final piece.\
